I write and produce electronic music as a hobby. I've released a few short albums, all of which are free to download from Bandcamp:

### Video game soundtracks

* [Cannon Crew](https://loganhood.bandcamp.com/album/cannon-crew) (2014)
* [Divide By Zero](https://loganhood.bandcamp.com/album/divide-by-zero) (2013)

### Original work

[Drone Riots - The Rapid Slide](https://droneriots.bandcamp.com/album/the-rapid-slide) (2012) is an album about freedom of information and speech.
