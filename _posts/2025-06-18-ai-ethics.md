title: "AI Ethics"
excerpt: ""

As a fully-remote worker, the majority of my conversations with my teammates are text-based.
It feels bad to send someone a message and get a *multi-faceted comprehensive response that hopefully
is a satisfactory answer to your fascinating question*.

I won't wade into ongoing politics of AI regulation,
but I can talk about my personal ethics.
If you work with me professionally, you've probably seen one of these:

* "AI Content Disclosure: The first draft of this document was created by GenAI from a human-written outline."
* "AI Content Disclosure: This code change was done with Q Chat. Here's the prompt I used..."

The absence of an AI Content Disclosure message means you're really talking to me.

Or as my friend qwen3:1.7b puts it:

> The golden rule of AI ethics asserts that when presenting AI-generated or
AI-assisted content, transparency must be prioritized to uphold trust and 
accountability. This involves clearly disclosing that the information was
created or enhanced by artificial intelligence, ensuring audiences understand
its limitations and origins. Such disclosure fosters informed decision-making,
prevents misinformation, and aligns with ethical standards in fields like
journalism, research, and public communication. By embracing this principle,
creators uphold integrity and maintain credibility in an increasingly AI-driven
world.
