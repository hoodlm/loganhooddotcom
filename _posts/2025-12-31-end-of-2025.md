## Fatherhood continues

Of course, my biggest accomplishment this year was - with the help of many other people - raising a baby human who is now almost a year old.

## AI?

Like many in the industry, the new tool in my toolbelt is AI, which really landed this year. (Or, maybe I was just a late adopter.) It's gone from a curiosity to a near-daily tool for coding and writing.

My ["AI Ethics" post from June](/2025/06/18/ai-ethics.html) still holds; the post you're reading now was written "raw". While that particular post was a bit of a ragepost, I have found a nice side effect of AI transparency is that it promotes sharing and collaborative learning across a _team_ of AI users. I continue to strongly recommend to everyone to overshare prompts and experiments.

While at work I stick with big state-of-the-art models (working at AWS has its perks, such as basically unlimited Bedrock usage for anything work-related) - I continue to experiment with local-first LLM tools right here on my own RTX 4070. Maybe more in this space coming in the future...

## PrimeGrid

I wrote a few blog posts - actually one big blogpost that I had to split up ([2025-10-02](/2025/10/02/primegrid-1.html), [2025-10-03](/2025/10/03/primegrid-2-ec2-spot.html), [2025-10-04](/2025/10/04/primegrid-3-ipv6.html)) - about PrimeGrid. It's not much of a hobby (there's not that much active *work* involved, as I'm not writing any of the programs, just running them) but it's fun to see results. My hardware found four prime numbers this year.

* `7177*2`<sup>`2316670`</sup>`+1` (697,392 decimal digits)
* `361467126`<sup>`131072`</sup>`+1` (1,121,724 digits, now 1351st largest known prime)
* `745*2`<sup>`4023044`</sup>`+1` (1,211,060 digits, 1048th largest)
* `73597220`<sup>`262144`</sup>`+1` (2,062,251 digits, 359th largest)

The broader PrimeGrid project made some significant discoveries this year, like the discovery of [the largest non-Mersenne prime at 13 million digits](https://t5k.org/primes/page.php?id=141162), and [the largest compositorial mega prime](https://t5k.org/primes/page.php?id=141301). My negative results and sieving, along with hundreds of other people, were a small part of these discoveries!

## Running

Back in 2023, I ran two marathons, but fell out of the running habit due to various excuses. Fast-forward to November 2025: as sometimes happens to people in their 30s, I stepped on a scale and saw a number _I did not like_. I have resumed running 3 times a week, with supplementary biking. Importantly, I gave myself something to train for (other than making the number on the scale go down): in April 2026, I will have the privilege of running a 15K with my dad, who is actively running (more than me) in his 60s!

## Civilization 2

I rekindled an interest in a classic PC game, Sid Meier's Civilization 2 (1996). There is a small but active community between [the CivFanatics forum](https://forums.civfanatics.com/categories/civilization-ii.5/) and a [Discord server](https://disboard.org/server/602566290564972554).

As of 2025, there's no way to legally _purchase_ a new copy or license of Civ2. While there's lots of interest - [see this petition on GoG](https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/sid-meier-s-civilization-ii) - there is apparently some copyright ambiguity that's prevented a reissue. I luckily, ahem, "found an old CD" and fired it up. Unlike many games from its era, Civ2 runs flawlessly on modern computers; natively in modern versions of Windows, and in WINE for Linux or macOS. The programmers did a nice job of future-proofing the UI; it scales automatically and looks quite nice on modern high-resolution displays.

### Open-source remake

Some community members have been working on a [open-source Civ2-compatible engine](https://www.github.com/axx0/Civ2-clone). I myself have been able to contribute a few simple features and fixes. While it's still early, it's impressive what axx0 and company have accomplished, and I'm very excited to be a small part of it.

### EV Nova mod for Civ2

As a creative outlet, I spent some time this year creating a mod for Civ2 - one based on another childhood favorite, Escape Velocity Nova. You can download it from [CivFanatics](https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/ev-nova-mge.32307/) or [github](https://github.com/hoodlm/evnova-civ2/releases/tag/v0.9).

The most interesting part of this project was adapting the ship sprites. I started with shipyard images from EV Nova itself, with some manual touch-up work after scaling down and recoloring to match Civ2's color palette. I don't have much practice with pixel art but learned some tricks like dithering (zoom in on the green rebel destroyers in the top left corner of the screenshot).

# What else is coming in 2026?

Pass! ["A goal for 2025: Learn to animate" (2025-01-02)](https://loganhood.com/2025/01/02/animation-skill-for-2025) didn't age well - I haven't touched Manim since I wrote the examples in this post. I make no promises for 2026. I guess, except that race I'm already signed up for.
