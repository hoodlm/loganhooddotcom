# Logan Hood - Software Development Engineer

I'm at my best as a hands-on-keyboard technical leader and teacher, working in and across an organization to
drive engineering excellence. To me, effective engineering leadership comes down to helping software teams
*do the right things, at the right time, in the right way*.

I designed and built systems, wrote software, and provided operational support for various EC2 products, including
VPC, Outposts, and Local Zones. More detail on specific projects available by request.

### 2013 - Summer Intern at Amazon

As an SDE intern, I worked on GameCircle, a platform for Amazon Kindle third-party game developers. My
specific project was a web portal to bulk-import leaderboard and achievement data from other mobile gaming
platforms.
