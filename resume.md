# Logan Hood - Software Development Engineer

I am currently professionally and financially satisfied working as a Principal Engineer at AWS, but I am open to new opportunities.
I strongly prefer fully-remote positions, but I'm willing to consider hybrid positions in the Charlotte, NC metro area.

Two (broad) areas I'm interested in for the future:

1. Security; not compliance box-checking and rent-seeking, but meaningful improvements that provides privacy and safety for real people.
2. Efficiency; getting more done with fewer kilowatts and less e-waste.

## Professional Experience

### 2014-Present - SDE at Amazon Web Services

I designed and built systems, wrote software, and provided operational support for various EC2 products, including
VPC, Outposts, and Local Zones.

Most recently I've worked on 
[second-generation AWS Outpost Racks](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-second-generation-aws-outposts-racks-with-breakthrough-performance-and-scalability-on-premises/)
and on improvements to AWS Local Zones.

Title/promo history:

* Software Engineer (2014-2018)
* Senior Software Engineer (2018-2025)
* Principal Engineer (current)

### 2013 - SDE Intern - Amazon GameCircle

GameCircle was a platform for Amazon Kindle third-party game developers. I built a
a web portal for developers to bulk-import leaderboard and achievement data from other mobile gaming
platforms.

## Skills

My primary languages are **Rust**, **Kotlin**, **Java**, and **Ruby**, with some work
in Bash, Python, C#, Typescript, and SQL.

I am experienced with leading complex, multi-team software projects through the software development lifecycle,
from design to launch to deprecation.

I particularly have expertise in designing, implementing, and operating large-scale distributed backend systems - request/reply
services, data distribution systems, and software-defined networking appliances.

## Education

* 2010-2014 - **B.S.E. Computer Science, Minor in Mathematics**, *University of South Carolina*, Columbia SC
